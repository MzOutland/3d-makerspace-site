# 3D Mobile Makerspace: How-To Guide Website

Overview:

A capstone project for CodeYou: Kentucky. The project using a third party API while showcasing knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Project Description

My capstone is a "How-to" website for creating a 3D Mobile Makerspace. The Website is designed to help educators and innovators plan, build, and manage a mobile 3D printing makerspace. It provides practical setup steps, equipment lists, instructional materials, and interactive features like a printer/tool search and teacher reservation form. Implementing 3D printing into the curriculum is an daunting task to undertake. My website will help educators have basic understanding of what to purchase when creating a 3D printing mobile makerspace.

## Project Organization

Currently, there are five pages of the website the user will be able to visit. The "home" page is the index page which holds links to the other web pages.

Important pages are:

1. index.html (Home page: begin here.)
2. start.html (includes the checklist for teachers to use)
3. 3dprinter-buying-guide.html (this page contains the fetch API)
4. 3dprinters.html (this page includes my mobile makerspace inventory)
5. contact.html (allows educators to contact me for more information)

# Features Implements

Fetch API using Sketchfab Viewer API. The purpose of the API is to provide the user with examples of 3D printers and 3D Designs. The search results will return thumbnails of the images fetched. More information for the Sketchfab API can be found at this link: https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer

## Installation Instructions

To set up the website locally:

Install Visual Studio Code to your computer. The link to download Visual Studio Code is: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Choose the version of Visual Studio Code for the Operating System installed on your PC or MAC.

Add the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension will allow the user to view the web pages locally. To install the Live Server extension, click on the "extension" icon, search for Live Server. Follow the installation instructions to install the extension.

Node.js will provide more features in the command line.

Use the fetch API to get images.
